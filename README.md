# Spearfishing Leviathan

![](https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMjAwNDc0Mi8xMTc4NjE2Ni5wbmc=/original/dfwU9L.png)

Action platformer about spearfishing Leviathan.

Written in Godot 4.0.2, using a C# build.

## How to run from source

Run `dotnet restore` in the repository's root directory, then open up the project in a C#-enabled build of Godot 4.0.2. You should be able to run the project from within the Godot editor with no further issues.

## Differences to the prebuilt version

Sound effects are not included in this source code, and addons that I used for authoring, but are not relevant to the final build, are also not included. These include:
